# HW-1:html-css-code-refactor 
## Description:
For this assignment I read through the existing html and css code to apply the right semantic elements for accesibility. 
Changed div tags to correct semantic elements(ie.header,nav,section,article,aside,footer)
Changed id and classes to define what certain elements do. Links and images
Added alt attribute to all image elements
Made sure headers are in correct order.
Added a descriptive title.

### Issues
I'm not sure if the alt tribute is the best way to display a title for the main image.
